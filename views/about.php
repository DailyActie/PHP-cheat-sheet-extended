			<h3>Who&#8217;s behind this ?</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Juliette Reinders Folmer. I&#8217;m a business consultant who just happens to have a knack for programming. I&#8217;m self-employed, operating under the name &#8220;<a href="http://adviesenzo.nl/">Advies en zo</a>&#8222; and am based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

			<h3>Why did you make this site ?</h3>
			<p>
				You know those really hard to debug irritating issues which can really drive you bonkers ?
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, so do I. And while trying to debug some of those, these cheat sheets were &#8216;born&#8217;. And I&#8217;ve been using them ever since.
			</p>


			
			<h3>Want to learn more or test your knowledge ?</h3>
			<p>
				Hire me ;-)
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on some of the gotcha&#8217;s I came across, I created <em>The Big &#8220;Why equal doesn&#8217;t equal&#8222; quiz</em>, a talk which I&#8217;ve presented at a number of PHP conferences and meetings.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you are a conference organizer and would like the add the quiz to your conference program, please contact me to make arrangements.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you work with PHP, manage a team of programmers or otherwise know people who could benefit from this knowledge, you can hire me to give an extended session at your company or organization.
				</li>
			</ul>
