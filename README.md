##### About the static versions of the sheets

Static versions of the cheatsheets are generated using a variety of PHP versions.

These PHP versions will include:
* [Always] Latest release for each minor PHP version at the time of (re-)generation of the static sheets
* [Always] The PHP versions included in [Ubuntu LTS releases](http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=Ubuntu)
* [Selectively] Popular minor releases based on [worldwide usage statistics](http://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php/all/all) at the time of (re-)generation of the static sheets
* [Selectively] Previously included versions if other no close minor release will be included

In general, a balance is sought between significance and variety.
