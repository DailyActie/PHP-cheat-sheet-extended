			<h3>Who's behind this ?</h3>
			<p>
				My name is Juliette Reinders Folmer. I'm a business consultant who just happens to have a knack for programming as well. I'm self-employed, have a company called "Advies en zo" and am based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

			<h3>Why ?</h3>
			<p>
				You know those really hard to debug irritating small issues which can really drive you bonkers ?
			</p>
			<p>
				Yeah, so do I. And while trying to debug some of those, these cheat sheets were 'born'. And I've been using them ever since.
			</p>


			
			<h3>Want to learn more or test your knowledge ?</h3>
			<p>
				Hire me ;-)
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on the gotcha's I came across, I created <em>The Big &ldquo;Why equal doesn't equal&rdquo; quiz</em>, a talk which I've presented at a number of PHP conferences and meetings. Conference organizers are very welcome to invite to do so at their conference. 
			</p>
			<p>
				If you'd like your team to improve their programming skills, you can hire me to give an extended session at your company.
